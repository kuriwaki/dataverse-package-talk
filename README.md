_Current Summary_


I show how new features of the [`dataverse` R package](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse-client-r) facilitate reproducibility in empirical, substantive projects. While packages and scripts make our _code_ transparent and portable across forms, the import of large and complex datasets is often a nuisance in project workflows that involve various data cleaning and wrangling tasks. And the GUI for [Dataverse](https://dataverse.org/) can be sometimes tedious to integrate into code-based workflow. Will Beasley and I, along with multiple other contributors,  updated the `dataverse` R package for the first time since 2017 with the goal of spreading its use in empirical workflow. In this iteration, we make it easier to retrieve dataframes of various file format and options for version specification and variable subsetting. I also discuss the latest updates to [pyDataverse](https://github.com/gdcc/pyDataverse/), a independent implementation in Python which is currently more advanced in its implementation but focused on uploading and creating datasets to dataverse.
